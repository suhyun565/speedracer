| CRUD 기능이 들어간 웹페이지 만들기 | 데이터를 저장,관리,조회,수정  |

- First, we will create a website with Django

What we want to make is a inventory management system like 배달의 민족(Baemin)’s B-mart.
By this system, we can manage sales and inventory.
*B-Mart is a food/ingredient delivery system made by 배달의 민족(Baemin). When you order, delivery man delivers ingredients and convenient foods within an hour. (It is like a delivered convenience store/mart. They(baemin) put small warehouses throughout the city and deliver goods from there.) 

- Expectation Result

Through this, people will be able to buy food faster and more conveniently.  
Especially, during Corona pandemic, people can buy things in non-face-to-face by this system.
